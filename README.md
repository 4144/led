# ABOUT

L-Ed is an open-source 2D level editor.

 - **Easy to use**: modern UI with a strong focus on ease-of-use and quality-of-life features.
 - **Customizable layers**: Integer grid layers, tile layers and entity layers support
 - **Entities**: fully customizable Entity fields (ex: you can have a "Mob" entity, with a "HP" field, which is an Int limited to [0,10] bounds).
 - **Integrated Enums**: you can define an enumeration (ex: an "ItemType" enum with "Money", "Ammo", "Gun" values) and use this enum in your entity custom fields.
 - **Bullet-proof Haxe API**: a powerful Haxe API which gives you access to fully typed values from your levels. It avoids mistakes like mistyping, renaming or removals: you see errors during compilation, not at runtime.
 - **JSON**: easy to parse format for any game-engine out there.

Even if it works great with the Haxe environement, it is completely compatible with any language or platform.
