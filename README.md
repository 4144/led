# ABOUT

L-Ed is an open-source 2D level editor.

 - Open-source.
 - **Easy to use**: a modern UI with a strong focus on ease-of-use and quality-of-life features.
 - **Customizable layers**: Integer grid layers, tile layers and entity layers support
 - **Entities**: fully customizable Entity fields (ex: you can have a "Mob" entity, with a "HP" field, which is an Int limited to [0,10] bounds).
 - **Integrated Enums**: you can define an enumeration (ex: an "ItemType" enum with "Money", "Ammo", "Gun" values) and use this enum in your entity custom fields.
 - Easy to parse JSON format.
 - Powerful Haxe API which gives you access to fully typed values from your levels.

Even if it works great with the Haxe environement, it is completely compatible with any language or platform.
